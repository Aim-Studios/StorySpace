<h2>What is StorySpace?</h2>
<p>
StorySpace is a website to create, read and enjoy stories with the community.
 StorySpace releases content in the form of issues, with each issue featuring 5 or more different stories.
 Issues will be released on the first of each month once 5 stories have been submitted.
 Issues will not be released without at least 5 stories.
</p>
<p>
You can add your stories to be featured in the next issue through the Add your story option.
 Once you have submitted your story, it will be emailed to the site's admin.
 These stories are not necessarily texts. 
 You can also submit your poems, comics and other forms of multimedia content.
 After a quick check by our staff, it will be added to the next available issue.
 You can see more details on the Add your story page.
