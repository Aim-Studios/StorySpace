<p>You can submit any form of multimedia content to our issues that have a story-telling value to it. 
Examples are short stories, stories, poems, comics, animated videos, short films, etc.

<h2>How does StorySpace work?</h2>
<p>Once you have submitted you content, your request will be emailed to the site's admin.
 Our team will then do a quick check and after that you content will be published to the next available issue.
 If there were any problems with your submission, we will notify you via email.
 When your content is published, it is uploaded to the admin's google drive from where the website accesses it if needed.
 We do our best to make this process safe, secure and transparent.</p>

<h2>How does StorySpace make profit?</h2>
<p>We do not, as of now. The site is an experimental project as is not meant to be commercial or profitable for now.
 Once the site gains a signifiant number of users, we may introduce ads to make some profit. But we are in no rush.
 The site will remain free forever, and will never require you to pay for enjoying or publishing content here.</p>

<div id = "box">
<h2>Is the site dynamic?</h2>
<p>
No, StorySpace is not a dynamic website, meaning it does not make use of server-side programs or databases to provide content.
 All updates made to the site are done manually by our admins. This includes the reviewing and addition of your contents to the issues.
